# Bi-Directional-API
Inspired by Dominoâ€™s Pizza online ordering system to send JSON  le of toppings to server, save in database, and send back frequent status updates to primary client. Utilized Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB for the storage system, Socket.io for bi-directional communication based by events, and Python for Raspberry Pi sending messages back.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Once project is downloaded locally, install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/), then [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and then the [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) object modeliing library for Node.js and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) real-time application framework by running:

```
$ npm install mongoose socket.io
```

### Running

Run server.js and enter the .html file to begin to interact. Further documentation for interaction with Raspberry Pi will be added at a later date.
